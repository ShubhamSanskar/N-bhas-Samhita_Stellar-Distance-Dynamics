Predicting Stellar Trajectories Using Machine Learning and Gravitational Dynamics


This repository contains the code and data associated with the paper "Predicting Stellar Trajectories Using Machine Learning and Gravitational Dynamics". The paper presents a novel methodology for forecasting the future paths of stars by analyzing their current and past positions, as well as the gravitational forces exerted on them. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the environment, running the code, and understanding the outputs.
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the future trajectories of stars within the Milky Way galaxy. By leveraging data from multiple astrophysical databases and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to provide precise predictions of stellar movements. The project utilizes Lasso Regression for model training, incorporates gravitational forces into the predictions, and provides detailed uncertainty estimates for each predicted trajectory.

Data Sources
      
The primary data sources used in this study include:
Gaia DR2: Provides precise astrometric data, including positions, parallaxes, and proper motions of stars.
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): Offers extensive spectral data for stellar classification.
Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS): Provides near-infrared observations essential for analyzing stellar properties.
These datasets collectively offer a comprehensive view of stellar characteristics and movements over time.
